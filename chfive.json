Again, the barcodes of each tray and books associated with it are scanned into the system. This second scan is compared to the first by the computer system and any discrepancies are brought to the attention of the system operator. \n\nThe warehouse manager keeps a chart of locations in the stack area indicating the shelves occupied by each client’s material. Using this chart, the manager produces location sheets indicating where each tray containing new accessions should be shelved. \n\nCarts are brought into the warehouse and the trays are loaded onto a Raymond lift.
