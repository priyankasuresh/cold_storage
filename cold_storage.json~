It is a true innovation—a new kind of library service center driven by the needs of librarians for more space and a better preservation environment and the concerns of administrators to control costs. As you are about to see, the Depository’s innovative construction and unique mode of operation enable it to do 4 things very well: provide a high level of physical control over materials, establish an ideal climate for paper-based materials and certain non-print media, ensure the rapid retrieval of materials on demand, and control costs associated with traditional library operations.\" ",

Research has shown that heat, humidity, air pollution, and exposure to ultraviolet light accelerate the deterioration of library materials. The Harvard Depository was designed to minimize these agents of deterioration—protecting materials and prolonging their useful life. Unlike a conventional library building, the design of the Depository eliminates many of the problems associated with controlling the environment. The building materials were chosen for their chemical stability to avoid any interaction with stored materials. The building envelope is heavily insulated and a continuous vapor barrier prevents the migration of humidity when the weather changes rapidly.\"",

Here barcode numbers for each tray and the books in it are scanned into the computer system. This initiates the electronic association for each item of the unique client barcode with the unique Depository tray barcode. \n\nWhen all of the trays on a cart have been processed, the cart is moved to the expedite station. Again, the barcodes of each tray and books associated with it are scanned into the system. This second scan is compared to the first by the computer system and any discrepancies are brought to the attention of the system operator. \n\nThe warehouse manager keeps a chart of locations in the stack area indicating the shelves occupied by each client’s material. Using this chart, the manager produces location sheets indicating where each tray containing new accessions should be shelved. \n\nCarts are brought into the warehouse and the trays are loaded onto a Raymond lift. Trays are then shelved according to the location sheets.\"",
