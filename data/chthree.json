It is a true innovation—a new kind of library service center driven by the needs of librarians for more space and a better preservation environment and the concerns of administrators to control costs. As you are about to see, the Depository’s innovative construction and unique mode of operation enable it to do 4 things very well: provide a high level of physical control over materials, establish an ideal climate for paper-based materials and certain non-print media, ensure the rapid retrieval of materials on demand, and control costs associated with traditional library operations.\" ",

Research has shown that heat, humidity, air pollution, and exposure to ultraviolet light accelerate the deterioration of library materials. The Harvard Depository was designed to minimize these agents of deterioration—protecting materials and prolonging their useful life. Unlike a conventional library building, the design of the Depository eliminates many of the problems associated with controlling the environment. The building materials were chosen for their chemical stability to avoid any interaction with stored materials. The building envelope is heavily insulated and a continuous vapor barrier prevents the migration of humidity when the weather changes rapidly.\"",
