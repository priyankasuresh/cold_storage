    <h6>About</h6>

<p>Cold Storage is a 24-minute documentary short film interlinked with an expanding collection of intertextual media artifacts, an archive of experiments and experiences in and around the Harvard Depository ("HD"), Harvard's off-site library storage facility. Taken together, the film and its associated media collection explore how libraries have changed from the "shrines to knowledge" of the past to the evolving networks that interconnect vast warehouses and patrons of the present. By looking at objects as varied as books, databases, and air-conditioning systems, what conversations about libraries of the future may be prompted? </br></p>

<p><b>The Library Beyond the Book</b></br>

Co-written by Jeffrey Schnapp and Matthew Battles, The Library Beyond the Book combines a deep study of the library's history with reflections and provocations for thinking about the future of libraries, in part drawing from their research initiatives at metaLAB. The film takes its name from the closing chapter of the book, Cold Storage, which is based upon an initial media reconnaissance mission to the Harvard Depository. It was also in this encounter that the impulse to dialogue with Alain Resnais' Toute la m&#233;moire du monde was born.</p> </br>

<p><b>Humanities Studio I : Cold Storage</b></br>

In the Spring of 2014, the metaLAB team taught its first course under the "humanities studio" rubric, combining a traditional humanities class experience with a making and process-based critical studio environment. Existing outside any single school or department, the course encouraged interdisciplinary enrollment, which resulted in a class composed of undergraduates, students from Harvard's Graduate School of Design, a student from the Graduate School of Education, and a cross-enrollment from MIT. </p></br>

<p>Starting from a series of storyboards imagining the journey of a book from the stacks to the hands of library patrons, the students and the teaching team then embarked on a series of field trips to the Harvard Depository site in Southborough-first creating a collective repository of photographs from which to develop more illustrated storyboards and eventually video and audio documentation that, while also shared to a degree, targeted students' individual production and editing capacities. While most student projects were based in video, a preliminary set of wireframes envisioning what this website might look like and a sound-mapping of the facility with wireframes for a corresponding interface were also developed in the context of the class.</p> </br>
